    <br />

    <p>
      To make lasagna, start by preparing a meat or vegetable sauce and a cheese
      mixture. Cook lasagna noodles until al dente. In a baking dish, layer the
      ingredients: start with a layer of sauce, then noodles, followed by
      cheese. Repeat the layers, finishing with a generous amount of cheese on
      top. Bake in the oven at 375째F (190째C) for about 45 minutes, until the top
      is golden and bubbly. Let it cool slightly before serving.
