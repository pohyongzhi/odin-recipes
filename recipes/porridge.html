    <h2>
      This porridge recipe is a winter favorite of ours that builds on a
      traditional British breakfast dish. We add sultanas, bananas, and
      cinnamon, and it's awesome.

      Combine water, oats, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Add bananas and
      cinnamon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the liquid is
      absorbed, stirring frequently. Serve in bowls and top with a splash of
      cold milk if desired.
